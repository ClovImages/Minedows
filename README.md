Introducing Minedows 98!
Feel like you're back in the old days with the modern video game Minecraft. You can do anything you want with windows, your surroundings, and even create!

Let's take a closer look at the features.

## This is your desktop:

You can customize the shortcuts, wallpapers, and color palette of your environment.

Now let's take a look at a couple of programs that come with the “Operating System.”

### Clovium

> Important: in order for the browser to work and be available, you need to install MCEF for 1.21.8 and above!

Now that we've discussed the apps, let's talk about
### Customization
You can set any wallpaper you like, for example: Perlin Noise with its colors, a boring solid color, or a familiar panorama. But that's not all! You can set your own wallpaper using your images in the world machine.
As mentioned earlier, you can customize the color palette of your theme or use ready-made ones in the “system.” Here is an example of a desktop in the “Urban environment” style:
